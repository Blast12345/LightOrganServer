// This is a modeling of how light works in the real world (i.e. not based on human perception).
// It is measured in terms of radiant flux, of which the SI unit is watts.
// Light mixing is inherently linear. 500 watts + 500 watts = 1000 watts
// And like light in the real world, the brightness is not capped, so it can be any arbitrarily large size.
